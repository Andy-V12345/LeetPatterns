# LeetPatterns.ai

**LeetPatterns.ai** is an AI-powered tool that helps you master algorithmic pattern recognition for LeetCode-style coding interviews.  
Instead of solving problems line-by-line, LeetPatterns helps you practice identifying the _type_ of solution — like BFS, Dynamic Programming, or Sliding Window — which is the kind of thinking that actually helps in real interviews.

## 🧠 Why LeetPatterns?

Most interview prep tools focus on solving problems.  
**LeetPatterns** focuses on training your pattern recognition skills — helping you answer the most important question first:

> _“How should I approach this problem?”_
